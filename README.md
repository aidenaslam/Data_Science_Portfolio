# Data Science Portfolio
Thank you for visiting my portfolio - the first four projects are from my Master's degree and full reports on these projects are available upon request. Most of my work has been focused on machine learning and my intentions for future projects include natural language processing, data visualisation and the deployment of models. Please do get in touch with me if you have any questions or feedback on my work. 

## Machine Learning

* [Road Traffic Accidents in the UK (2005-2015)](https://github.com/aidenaslam/UK_Road_Accidents): the UK government is consistently looking for new ways to improve road safety. This project utilised recurrent neural networks and clustering to predict the number of road accidents and help identify the areas of improvement needed in road safety in the UK. 

* [Predicting Heart Disease in Patients](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Predicting-Heart-Disease-in-Patients): Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally and in 2016 they represented 31% of all global deaths [1]. In this study, the Framingham Heart Study data [2] was sourced in order to construct a model, using a variety of machine learning algorithms, that can accurately classify whether a person will develop coronary heart disease (CHD) or not.

* [Classifying Smartphone Prices](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Classifying-Smartphone-Prices): In todayâ€™s competitive technology sector, it is very difficult for smaller brands to compete for market share in the smartphone industry. In 2019 the top 5 vendors of smartphones (Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi and OPPO) had a combined market share reaching over 70%. Thus, this project aimed to classify the price range of a given smartphone based on its features using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The application of such a model could then be used to help provide smaller brands with a better idea on how to provide consumers with an affordable smartphone with features in-line with the most up-to-date technology which in turn would increase sales. 

* [Predicting Flight Delays: A Case Study of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Predicting-Flight-Delays-A-Case-Study-of-Hartsfield-Jackson-Atlanta-International-Airport-ATL-): The US aviation industry in the last decade has experienced an ever-increasing demand of passengers. This is requiring airports to evaluate their current strategies and be able to adapt to changing industrial environments to not only provide a better service towards airlines and passengers, but to maximise profit through efficient operation. One way to achieve this is by efficiently organising and handling airport capacity. The aim of this study was therefore, to implement deep learning to accurately predict the arrival delay of flights at ATL in the US to assist with airport capacity planning for the ever-increasing passenger demand.

## Natural Language Processing

* [Text Classification of Sports News Articles](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Text-Classification-Sports-News): Text classification is becoming an increasingly important part of businesses as it allows to easily get insights from data and automate business processes. In this project web scraping was performed to create a dataset of sports news headlines alongside the name of the sport in order to construct a model, using machine learning, that can accuratley classify the type of sport a headline presents. This project improved my skills in sourcing data via web scraping and handling unstructured datasets.

* [Sentiment Analysis of Airbnb Tweets](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Airbnb-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis): Brands are typically defined by the services they provide. With the use of social media to communicate the successes and failures of brands, data scientists are taking advantage of this unstructured data to help companies like Airbnb continue to build and improve their brand through social campaigning, customer service and online marketing. This project had the goal of using the Twitter API to collect data on the hashtag *airbnb* and use this data to build a classifier model that can predict whether the tweet is positive, neutral or negative. 

* [Retrieval Chatbot using Python, Flask and Twilio](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Retrieval-Chatbot): Chatbots have become increasingly popular to make it easy for users to find the information they need and help reduce costs in customer service. In this project, I took on the challenge of creating a retrieval-based chatbot that responds via WhatsApp using the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox API. The goal of this project was to apply deep learning to the dataset I constructed manually that mimics my own personality and style of interaction. 

## Computer Vision

* [CNN Classifier to Predict Damage Sustained by Vehicle](https://github.com/aidenaslam/Motor-Insurance-Claims-Classifier): Currently in Deployment.
